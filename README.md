# Credict Card Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement
The Thera bank recently saw a steep decline in the number of users of their credit card.
Customers’ leaving credit card services would lead the bank to loss, so the bank wants to analyze the data of customers and identify the customers who will leave their credit card services and the reason for same – so that the bank could improve upon those areas.

We as a Data Scientist at Thera Bank need to explore the data provided, identify patterns, and come up with a classification model to identify customers likely to churn, and provide actionable insights and recommendations that will help the bank improve its services so that customers do not renounce their credit cards.
